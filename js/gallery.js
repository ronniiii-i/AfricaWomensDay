      "FreshSource is revolutionizing the agricultural landscape in the MENA region, positively impacting producers, businesses, and consumers through its groundbreaking technology-driven supply platform. Recognizing the vulnerabilities of global supply chains highlighted by recent geopolitical events, Farah and Omar Emara, the visionary siblings behind FreshSource, set out on a mission to bolster Egypt's food security and modernize its distribution practices.Drawing from their family's deep-rooted connection to the agricultural supply chain, the Emara siblings understood the pressing need for technological advancements to address issues such as high food loss rates and the exploitation of farmers. They embarked on a journey of exploration, piloting various distribution models from around the world to identify the most effective approach for Egypt.A pivotal moment arrived when they witnessed the tech-savviness of farmers, purchasing managers, and vendors who readily embraced change and welcomed innovative solutions. This inspired Farah and Omar to create an app and website, forming the backbone of FreshSource's technology-based solution. The FreshSource model seamlessly integrates technology with supply chain logistics and execution. Working closely with partner farmers across approximately 5,000 farms, FreshSource takes charge of the entire process, ensuring proper handling through packaging, storage, and grading within their own warehouses.",
